"# Deep-Learning-Detection-Of-EEG-Based-Attention" 

**Project Description** 


This project is to predict usersâ€™ attention and cognitive load through EEG signals during their reading. EEG provides rich information about brain activities, and it is often complex in temporal- and spatial-dimensions, thus challenging to manually extract features. Recent deep learning models, especially Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), have demonstrated promising results in automatically learning meaningful representations from such complex signals. In this project, we will build on top of the state-of-the-art deep learning models to process EEG signals, extract features, and predict attention scores from the features. This will help us to quantitatively assess the temporal patterns and channels of EEG signals correspond to self-perceived attention.
